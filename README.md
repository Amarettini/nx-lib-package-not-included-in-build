# Help needed with Nx
This demo repository recreates the runtime error message ive been struggling with trying to resolve.
Commands and steps that led to this point:

- `nx generate @nx/js:lib is-even`; test-runner: none; bundler: tsc;
- `nx generate @nx/js:lib is-odd`; test-runner: none; bunder: tsc;
- `nx build is-even`; build succeeded
- `npm install -D @nx/node`;
- `nx g @nx/node:app launcher`; framework: none;
- `nx serve launcher`; build succeeded; runtime error stack trace: 
```

Instead change the require of index.js in C:\Users\ppyrz\Dev\Side\nx-lib-package-not-included-in-build\dist\apps\launcher\apps\launcher\src\main.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.

Module missmatch between the libs (ESM) and the app (CJS). So i switched `target.build.options.format` in the launchers `project.json` from "cjs" to "esm". Saved and reran again with: 

- `nx serve launcher`; build succeeded; runtime error stack trace ive been fighting with all day...:
```

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
